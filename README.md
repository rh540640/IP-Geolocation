# IP-Geolocation
Takes an IP address as input and uses the geo ip lookup tool to determine the geographic location of the IP.

To use the script, save it to a file (e.g. ip-geolocate.sh) and make it executable using chmod +x ip-geolocate.sh. Then, run the script using the command ./ip-geolocate.sh. The script will prompt you for the IP address to geolocate and will use the geoiplookup command to determine the geographic location of the IP address. The script will then display the location information. Note that the geoiplookup tool must be installed on your system for the script to work.
